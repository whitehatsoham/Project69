        <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun. At minimum:Infinity WarCivil, WarBlack, PantherAge ofAnt Man, and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot. There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles. Must go to bathroom just before the movie because it does last 3 hours all worthwhile.
